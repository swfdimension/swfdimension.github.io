        <h2>Major changes coming over summer - May 27th, 2019</h2>
      <h3>Bootlegbilly</h3>
        <p>
          Hey guys, been a while hasn't it. So Susordini doesn't want to work on SwfRunner anymore so I'm taking charge now. While I haven't added too many new games recently as I've been busy, the site will be getting new games. If you have any specific requests, please remember to use the <a href="/feedback.html">feedback</a> page.
      </p>
        <h2>Major changes coming over summer - May 27th, 2019</h2>
        <h3>Bootlegbilly</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm bootlegbilly. I've been working on swfrunner with Susorodni for some time now. But as of now I'm officially on the team! You might've noticed that there have been some bugfixes n' stuff all over the site, since I spent all day today working on it. So anyways, with a new person on the team, there are gonna be some major changes to the site that'll be added over summer. There's gonna be some changes in how we add games to the site that'll make it really quick to add games instead of the slow method we use, which should mean there'll be a ton of new games. We're also thinking of adding ads (gross ik) so that we can work on here for way longer than we do right now. Besides just that, there's gonna be a ton of changes that we hope you all will enjoy, plus a competition that may possibly be happening soon ;);). Anyways thought, thanks a lot, have fun, and remember, We play not pay</p>
        <p>
          All the best
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          P.S. We are looking at <a href="/feedback.html">feedback</a> and are working to implement it whenever we have a free moment.

            <h2>Why no Unity games are on SWFWorld</h2>
            <h3>Susorodni</h3><br>
            <p>A lot of requests for games in the feedback page are for Unity games, such as Rooftop Snipers, Ping Pong Chaos, and more.
      Unity shut down their Unity Web Player about a year ago, and since then it has been really hard to add Unity Games to websites, making
      it extremely difficult for us to add Unity games. We are still trying to figure out how to add them, so we will tell you once we
      are able to.</p>

            <p>Well here's where all the new updates and articles are going to be located in the future! Since this replaces the patch notes block,
              there's an image slideshow that takes it's place. If you want anything on that slideshow, please tell us in the feedback page!
              So this update mainly focuses on the style of the website.
              We didn't really have any time to add any new games, sorry for that, but we will next update! Oh, and you're probably wondering what the fingerprint is
            on the new menu. Be prepared to find out!</p>
